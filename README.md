# Hotel-booking-analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to identify the causes of booking cancellations. By understanding the patterns in cancellations, hotel management can take proactive measures to improve customer retention and satisfaction. The analysis highlights the regions with the highest cancellation rates and explores the factors contributing to these cancellations.

Problem Statement
The primary objectives of this project are:

To identify the main causes of booking cancellations.
To determine which regions experience the highest cancellation rates.
To present findings in an accessible manner for non-technical stakeholders.
Data Description
The dataset used for this analysis includes information on hotel bookings, such as:

Reservation Status Date: The date when the reservation was made.
Cancellation Indicator: Whether the booking was canceled or not.
Hotel Region: The geographical area where the hotel is located.
Lead Time: The time between booking and arrival date.
Guest Details: Information about the guests, including number of adults and children.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for analysis.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Library for creating visualizations.
Scikit-learn: Library for implementing machine learning algorithms (if applicable).
Analysis & Visualizations
The analysis consists of several key steps:

Data Cleaning: Ensuring the data is free of inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to uncover patterns.
Visualizations: Creating graphs and charts to illustrate findings.
Cancellation Rates by Region: A bar chart showing the percentage of cancellations for each region.
Lead Time vs Cancellation: A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between lead time and cancellation rates.
Guest Composition Analysis: A pie chart showing the distribution of guest types in canceled bookings.
